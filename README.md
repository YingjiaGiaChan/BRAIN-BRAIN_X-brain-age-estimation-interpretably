Code Availability Statement

The code associated with this project is currently not publicly available. However, upon the acceptance of the manuscript titled "BRAIN: A Balanced Region-Aware Interpretive Network for Brain Age Estimation" for publication, the full code will be made publicly accessible in this repository.

We aim to provide open access to the model and its associated tools to encourage reproducibility and further research in the field of brain age prediction. Once available, the code will include detailed instructions for installation, training, and evaluation.

Thank you for your patience and understanding.
